Value types:

* A Value type holds the data within its own memory allocation.
* A Reference type contains a pointer to another memory location that holds the real data.

* A data type is a value type if it holds a data value within its own memory space.
* It means the variables of these data types directly contain values.

* Unlike value types,a Reference type doesn't store its value directly.Instead, it stores the address where the value is being stored.
* In other words, a Reference type contains a pointer to another memory location that holds the data.
